# Content semantics

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Create an `index.html` file inside the repository.
- Write all the HTML we discussed in class for the beets website.
- Remember to do regular commits.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Goal

It **will not** look the same as the PDFs from earlier in class—we’re only concentrating on HTML semantics not how it looks.

## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit to Canvas using Markbot.
